# Active Context

## Current Work
Improving bot detection and browser automation:
1. Migrated to patchright for undetected mode
2. Automated Chromium installation
3. Removed custom stealth implementation
4. Enhanced bot detection avoidance

Previous work on timeout issues:
1. Google search tool timeouts
2. Page visit timeouts
3. Resource cleanup issues
4. Error handling improvements

## Recent Changes

### 1. Bot Detection Improvements
- Migrated from playwright to patchright for better bot detection avoidance
- Added automated Chromium installation via postinstall script
- Removed custom stealth implementation in favor of patchright's built-in features
- Updated type system to use patchright consistently
- Improved documentation for browser requirements
- Configured non-headless mode for better undetectability
- Simplified browser context settings per patchright recommendations
- Removed potentially detectable browser options
- Added fallback to default Chromium if Chrome not found
- Improved browser launch error handling

### 2. Core Timeout Handling
- Added proper timeout cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Added comprehensive list of non-retryable errors
- Implemented exponential backoff with jitter
- Fixed timeout race conditions
- Added better error categorization

### 2. Google Consent Handling
- Added pre-emptive consent cookies
- Implemented mutation observer for early detection
- Reduced consent handling timeouts
- Added JavaScript click fallback

### 3. Operation Timeouts
- Added granular timeouts for each operation (3s)
- Added overall operation timeout (10s)
- Improved timeout error handling
- Added proper cleanup on failures

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Reduced individual operation timeouts
- Added better resource cleanup
- Improved memory management
- Added proper interval cleanup

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Monitor timeout improvements
2. Verify resource cleanup
3. Test error recovery
4. Validate consent handling

### Short Term
1. Add performance monitoring
2. Implement request queuing
3. Add session persistence
4. Improve error reporting

### Long Term
1. Add automated testing
2. Implement load balancing
3. Add metrics collection
4. Improve documentation

## Known Issues
1. Potential race conditions in browser cleanup
2. Memory usage spikes during heavy load
3. Network errors during consent handling
4. Session cleanup delays

## Monitoring Needs
1. Operation timeout frequency
2. Resource usage patterns
3. Error rates and types
4. Performance metrics
